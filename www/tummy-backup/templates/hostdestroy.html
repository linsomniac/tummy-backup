    <h2>Warning:</h2>

    <p />Clicking on this button will destroy the backups for ${hostname}
    and all snapshots of data associated with it.  All this data will be
    destroyed permanently.

    <h2>Note:</h2>

    <p />This operation will return immediately, and run in the background.
    Destroying a host can take a long time, possibly hours for a large set
    of backups.  You can check the web page for this server to check the
    progress, first all the backups associated with this host will be
    removed, then the host itself will be removed.

    <form name="configform" method="POST">
      <input type="submit" onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you wish to destroy this host and *ALL* backup data associated with it?')"
            value="Destroy ${hostname}" />
