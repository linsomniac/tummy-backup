These instructions were created on Ubuntu 12.04.

You need a 64-bit install because ZFS is generally considered to be
happier under 64-bit, and the PPA only supports 64-bit..

Install ZFS:

   Based on this guide:

      https://github.com/zfsonlinux/pkg-zfs/wiki/HOWTO-install-Ubuntu-to-a-Native-ZFS-Root-Filesystem

   apt-get install python-software-properties
   apt-add-repository --yes ppa:zfs-native/stable
   apt-get update
   apt-get install debootstrap ubuntu-zfs
   modprobe zfs
   Edit /etc/default/zfs and set "ZFS_MOUNT" and "ZFS_UMOUNT" to "yes".

Create ZFS pool for backups:

   You will need one or more device partitions to store the ZFS on.  Ideally,
   you would give ZFS a number of raw devices rather than a RAID array device.
   Best performance is if you use the full device ("/dev/sda" rather than
   "/dev/sda1").

   For device names, you typically want to use the device files in
   /dev/disk/by-id.

   If you have one big device, use:

      zpool create -o ashift=12 backups DEV_FILE

   If you have many devices and want to be able to survive a single device
   failure:

      zpool create -o ashift=12 backups raidz DEV_FILE [...]


   If you want to be able to survive 2 device failures, at the cost of losing
   two discs worth of storage capacity:

      zpool create -o ashift=12 backups raidz2 DEV_FILE [...]

Tuning ZFS

   You probably want to enable compression:

      zfs set compression=on backups

   You *MIGHT* want to set deduplication:

      zfs set dedup=verify backups

   However, deduplication can be very hard on the system.  It needs plenty of
   RAM, probably at least 8GB, and ideally should have a L2ARC device on SSD:

      zpool add backups cache SSD_DEV_FILE

Install Requirements

   apt-get install python-psycopg2 libapache2-mod-wsgi postgresql mailutils

Install tummy-backup Master

   su postgres -c 'createuser -DRSP tummybackup'
   <Enter a password for the database connection>
   su postgres -c 'createdb -O tummybackup tummybackup'
   su postgres -c 'psql -d tummybackup --quiet' <schema.sql
